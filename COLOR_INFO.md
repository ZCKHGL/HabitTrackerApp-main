# 🎨 Updated Color System

## Automatic Color Assignment

Habit colors are now **automatically assigned** based on category:

### 🔵 Good Habits → Blue
- Color: `#42A5F5` (Light Blue)
- Represents positive habits to build
- Visual encouragement

### 🔴 Bad Habits → Red
- Color: `#EF5350` (Red)
- Represents habits to reduce/eliminate
- Warning/awareness indicator

## Why This Change?

1. **Simpler UX** - No need to pick colors manually
2. **Clear Meaning** - Blue = good, Red = bad (universal understanding)
3. **Consistent** - Same color logic across all screens
4. **Faster** - Create habits quicker without color selection step

## Where You'll See It

- ✅ Habit cards
- ✅ Heatmap calendar (blended with intensity)
- ✅ Analytics charts
- ✅ History logs
- ✅ Detail popups

## Migration

Existing habits will automatically get colors based on their category. No action needed!
